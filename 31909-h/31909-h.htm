<h2>DOCTOR BOLUS<br
 /><small>AND HIS PATIENTS.</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><img class="initial" src="images/dropo.png" alt="O" title=""
 /><span class="uc">ld</span> Doctor Bolus was an old fashioned Doctor, and every morning started
out with his cane, to visit his patients, sometimes taking with him his
student, a man who had taken to studying medicine at thirty years
<!-- png.006 folio 4 -->old, in
the hope of being the successor of Doctor Bolus.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-006.png" width="461" height="371"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>We will follow the Doctor&#8217;s rounds for one morning. First he called at the
Squire&#8217;s, whose father was sick. The Doctor examined his tongue, felt his
pulse, and mixed a white powder and a gray powder, giving directions for
him to take a little every two hours. Then, after talking
<!-- png.007 folio 5 -->over the state
of the crops with the Squire, he went on to his next patient, old black
John, the colored man. John was very poor, but a good Quaker had relieved
his wants and the Doctor gave him a dose of calomel, telling him he would
soon be at work again.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-007.png" width="437" height="369"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>The Doctor&#8217;s next call was to see little Kitty Green, the merchant&#8217;s
<!-- png.008 folio 6 -->daughter; Kitty had meddled with a sharp knife, and cut her finger pretty
severely; if she had been a poor man&#8217;s daughter it would have got well
without the doctor, but rich people can afford to call the doctor for
little things, so Doctor Bolus applied some salve to Kitty&#8217;s finger, and
she was soon playing again.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-008.png" width="431" height="309"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>The next patient was Mrs. Droley, who always imagined she was sick, and
had been one of the Doctor&#8217;s
<!-- png.009 folio 7 -->regular patients for several years; and if a
few days passed without his calling on her, he was sure to be sent for.
Mrs. Droley kept her room and her bed much of the time, thinking she had
only strength to feed her cat. The doctor could not do her much good, but
gave her a little harmless medicine.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-009.png" width="370" height="357"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>The last call the Doctor made before his dinner, was at Mrs. Smith&#8217;s.
<!-- png.010 folio 8 -->She
had been sick for a long time, and a few months before this her husband
had been drawn in to commit a robbery, for which he was sentenced to
imprisonment for life. She was rapidly failing, and would soon die. She
had mourned only that she must leave her little daughter destitute, but
was now assured that a good home was provided for Mary by her friends; and
she felt that she could die happy.</p>

<h2>DOCTOR BOLUS<br
 /><small>AFTER DINNER.</small></h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">After</span> dinner Doctor Bolus went to visit a very poor woman, who was sick
with a lung fever, and all
<!-- png.012 folio 2 -->alone, only when a colored girl came in to help
her, or to read to her. The Doctor knew he could not cure her, and only
gave her a little medicine to soothe her pain.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-012.png" width="435" height="361"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>His next visit was to Susan Blake, a little girl of ten years old, who was
very sick, and could not recover. She had one sister, and they were
orphans. It was hard indeed for them to part, but they both knew
<!-- png.013 folio 3 -->that death would soon separate them.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-013.png" width="423" height="307"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>Doctor Bolus was next called to pull a tooth for a little girl, (see
<a href="#frontis">frontispiece</a>,) and then went to see Joe Glutton as he was called. Joe well
deserved the name for his greediness; a day or two before he had slily
climbed up to a dish of sweetmeats, and eaten very freely of them; that
night he was taken severely sick, and was obliged to take much bitter
medicine. This was not the
<!-- png.014 folio 4 -->first time he had suffered for his greediness.
The Doctor had a fine pear tree which was often robbed; when the pears
were ripe, he had inserted emetics in several of the finest of them, and
soon after was called to visit Joe, who had been suddenly taken with
vomiting; the Doctor soon relieved him, but found he had been eating his
pears.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-014.png" width="446" height="365"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p class="ctr top4"><img src="images/illo-015.png" width="398" height="315"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>The next place was at the carpenter&#8217;s,
<!-- png.015 folio 5 -->where the baby and the grandfather
were both sick. The grandfather was a very old man, and loved to tell over
the story of his settling in the wilderness, when a young man. The Doctor
left medicine for them, and then went on to Mrs. Thorn&#8217;s whose daughter
was sick. He found the mother spinning, and the daughter trying to sew as
she lay on the bed. Mrs. Thorn&#8217;s husband and six children had died
<!-- png.016 folio 6 -->with consumption, and now the last, and youngest, on whom the mother had
depended for aid, was wasting away with the same disease. The mother
grieved deeply, but was cheerful, and said she hoped to meet them in
heaven.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-016.png" width="435" height="359"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>Next he called to see a little girl who had been sick for several days
with a violent fever; he had been afraid she would die, but now found
<!-- png.017 folio 7 -->her better, and the danger past.
Her brother was standing by her, trying to
draw her attention to a brood of chickens which had been hatched since she
was shut up by sickness.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-017.png" width="377" height="375"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>The Doctor had now finished his calls; but as he was walking home he was
called to a young lady who had been with a party of young people, sailing
on the pond, and in reaching
<!-- png.018 folio 8 -->over too far had fallen into the water. The
party were frightened, and it was sometime before she was taken out. The
Doctor tried for several hours to restore her, but it was in vain; she was
dead, and the whole village mourned over the sudden and sad death.</p>

England they were well off, and were well taught by their mother, who took
much pains to lead them in the right way, and to teach them how they might
be happy
<!-- png.022 folio 4 -->here and hereafter. They lived in a pretty cottage near the sea
shore, where they could sometimes hear the waves dash against the rocks in
a storm. They played together, ate their meals together, sometimes sharing
them with the cat; they often walked together, and frequently rode out
with their father and mother.</p>

<p><!-- png.023 folio 5 -->When Jane was ten years old and John eight, their father lost most of his
property, and decided to go to America with his family. They crossed the
ocean safely, but soon after they arrived in America their father and
mother were both taken sick, and after being sick, the father for a few
days, and the mother for several weeks, both died; the little
<!-- png.024 folio 6 -->property
they left was seized by their landlord, and John and Jane were left
entirely destitute and alone.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-024.png" width="435" height="359"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>Jane knew they had an uncle in a town in Ohio, and they had no other way
but to beg their way to him. They traveled several hundred miles on foot
to Ohio, begging their way; at first, in the city and until they had
traveled to a distance
<!-- png.025 folio 7 -->from it, people were often unkind to them; they
went ragged, frequently hungry, and sometimes found it very difficult to
learn their way; but after they got into the country towns many pitied
them, and not only gave them food, but supplied them with clothes, and
took pains to direct them on their way to the place where their uncle
lived.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-025.png" width="417" height="299"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>At last they reached their uncle&#8217;s; they were kindly received, and their
<!-- png.026 folio 8 -->uncle adopted them as his own children. Their sufferings were then at an
end; but they never forgot their sorrowful journey, nor the good things
their mother had taught them in their pleasant home in England, and tried
not only to remember but to obey her teachings.</p>

GEORGE DENTON,<br

<p class="noindent"><img class="initial" src="images/dropg.png" alt="G" title=""
 /><span class="uc">eorge Denton</span> was a bad boy, and was constantly getting himself or others
into trouble. One afternoon, when sent to school, he played truant, and
started for a walk, ready for any mischief that might come to his hand.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-029.png" width="389" height="302"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p class="ctr top4"><img src="images/illo-030.png" width="419" height="339"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>He first went into a grove not far
<!-- png.030 folio 4 -->from the school house, where one of the
school boys had showed him a bird&#8217;s nest, which George promised him he
would not disturb. Not regarding his promise, he now climbed the tree and
got the nest, which contained several young birds; then, not knowing what
to do with the nest, he sat under a tree and held it for a little while,
but getting tired of this, and not knowing what to do
<!-- png.031 folio 5 -->with it, he left it
in the bushes where the young birds would perish. He then went to find
James, another bad boy with whom he often played, and with whom he had
many times planned mischief.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-031.png" width="404" height="306"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p class="ctr top4"><img src="images/illo-032.png" width="438" height="352"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>On his way he passed a field where a number of reapers were engaged in
cutting the grain; coming to a spot where they had left their jackets, he
removed one of them and hid it under a bush thus obliging the
<!-- png.032 folio 6 -->owner to
make a long search for it after he had finished his day&#8217;s work. He found
James, and with him two other boys; they were just starting to rob an
orchard, and James went with them; they got their pockets full of fruit,
and the other boys then left them. George and James sat under a tree by
the brook, eating their fruit, till they saw an old crazy man near them,
trying to cross the
<!-- png.033 folio 7 -->brook on a tree that had been laid across it. The boys
jumped on the tree and shook it to frighten him; but James willing to
frighten George as well as the old man, slily tripped him into the water,
and then ran away.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-033.png" width="405" height="316"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>George was frightened and very angry, but scrambled out of the water, and
wandered about for an hour or two in his wet clothes, fearing to go home,
and wishing he had gone
<!-- png.034 folio 8 -->to school. At last he started for home; a carriage
passing him, he jumped up behind it for a ride, but soon received a severe
blow from the driver&#8217;s whip. He then hurt himself in jumping off the
carriage, but soon reached home, wet, tired, lame and dirty, and received
a severe punishment from his father.</p>

LONG JAKE,<br
 /><small>THE ENGLISH BEGGAR.</small></h2>

<p class="noindent"><img class="initial" src="images/dropj.png" alt="J" title=""
 /><span class="uc">acob Longley</span>, or &lsquo;long Jake,&rsquo; as he was afterwards called, was born in
London. His parents were beggars, and they trained Jacob to their
business. When very small he was sent out with an older sister that he
might learn how to beg. When
<!-- png.038 folio 4 -->a little older, he was sent alone; sometimes
in rags, to get charity by his raggedness, at other times well dressed, to
tell a story of sickness and suffering at home. If not successful in
getting money, he was made to go without his supper, and sometimes beaten.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-038.png" width="394" height="392"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>Poor Jake was never taught that lying was wrong, but was praised if
<!-- png.039 folio 5-->he
could get money by an artful story, and did not know that begging was any
more dishonorable than working. How thankful ought those children to be
who are taught what is right, while so many others are taught to do wrong.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-039.png" width="311" height="226"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>When Jake grew older, he became very expert in learning how to frame and
tell a tale of wo, and how to assume an appearance of want. In this
country we see little of the deception practised by beggars in other
countries. The appearance of feebleness or lameness is put on, a
<!-- png.040 folio 6 -->leg is
sometimes doubled up and a wooden leg substituted for it, deafness and
blindness are assumed, and many other arts are resorted to, to move the
charitable feelings of the benevolent.</p>

<p class="ctr top4"><img src="images/illo-041.png" width="377" height="377"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>When Jake became a man he continued to beg, assuming more and more the
appearance of misery; sometimes professing to be a soldier,
<!-- png.041 folio 7 -->or a wrecked
sailor, sometimes pretending to have lost all he had by fire, sometimes to
have been disabled by a long sickness. Sometimes he appeared to be a very
old and infirm man, but when teazed by rude boys they would learn to their
sorrow that he could run after them very rapidly, and lay his staff over
them with heavy blows; but directly
<!-- png.042 folio 8 -->would appear a feeble old man again.
Jake gained a living without work, but it was but a poor living, in
ignorance, and sin, and often in want.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illo-042.png" width="401" height="323"
 alt="" title="" /></p>

<p>At last he came in reality to be an old man, and a fit object of charity.
Too feeble to beg, he was sent to the workhouse; he had lived but a poor
life here, and died in ignorance of the way to secure happiness in the
life to come.</p>

<p>When Rufus was a little boy he behaved well, obeyed his parents, and was
kind to his sister. He used to go to school and to Sunday School with her,
and they studied their lessons together; but as he grew older he began to
get acquainted with bad boys, and preferred playing with them in the
street to playing with Maria at home. He is now a big boy, has
<!-- png.050 unnumbered folio -->learned to
fight, and thinks it manly to smoke a cigar and to swear. His father and
mother have taken a great deal of pains to induce him to break off his
evil habits, but if he follows his present course, he will become a bad
and miserable man, and be likely to come to an untimely end by accident or
the punishment of crime.</p>

<p>We invite the attention of dealers and teachers to the above new series of
Globes, manufactured by us. They are strongly made, highly finished, and
each Globe is put up in a handsome case.</p>

<p>By an improved and entirely new process of manufacturing, (the ball being
made of a material different from that heretofore used, and much better
for the purpose,) the result of a long course of study and experiment,
they are very much stronger than other Globes, and less liable to crack or
be broken by a fall or other accident.
<!-- png.064 unnumbered folio -->In this respect they are far
superior to any other Globes.</p>

<p>Another and very great improvement in these Globes is, the substitution of
a beautiful metallic frame in place of the wood frame heretofore used,
thus making it an ornamental article for the parlor, library, or school
room.</p>

<p>Each Globe, (excepting the parlor pattern, which is put up only in packing
cases,) is put up in a neat case, with lid secured by a catch; or at a
higher price in an ornamental black walnut case, secured with lock. The
case opens readily, so as to display the Globe, and so that it may be
conveniently used without taking it therefrom, and effectually protects it
from liability to accident and from dust: a great desideratum in the
school room. The Celestial Globe is put up in the same variety of styles.</p>

<p class="bot4">They are printed on new plates, which are engraved in a superior manner,
